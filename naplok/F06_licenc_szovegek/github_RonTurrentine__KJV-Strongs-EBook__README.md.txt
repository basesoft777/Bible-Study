  **Remind Tomorrow** — updates never touch your downloaded content, and a
  manual "Update Now" appears in the ☰ menu if you snooze

## Quick Start

### Option A — Electron Launcher (easiest, recommended for new installs)

Download `KJV Strong's Bible Setup.exe` from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/RonTurrentine/KJV-Strongs-EBook/releases) and run it. The launcher will:
- Install PowerShell 7+ if needed
- Download all required source files automatically
- Generate all 1,189 chapters and 14,298 dictionary pages
- Start the study server and open the Bible in an embedded window

> **Note:** Your antivirus may scan files during setup — this is normal and harmless. If asked to allow or trust the app, click **Allow**.

### Option B — Manual Setup

### Requirements
- PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`)
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) — for Kindle push
- SQLite3 — for BDB/Thayer lexicon export

### Source files required (not in repo — too large)
Place these in the project root:
- `kjv.osis.xml` — KJV Bible in OSIS format with Strong's numbers
- `StrongHebrewG.xml` — Hebrew Strong's lexicon
- `strongsgreek.xml` — Greek Strong's lexicon
- `bdb-thayer.dct.mybible` — BDB/Thayer lexicon (SQLite, from MyBible)

### Generation (one-time setup)

```powershell
# 1. Export BDB/Thayer lexicon
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\export-bdb.ps1

# 2. Generate all 1,189 Bible chapters + concordance index
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\generate_bible.ps1

# 3. Generate all 14,298 dictionary pages with BDB definitions
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\generate_dict.ps1

# 4. Verify output (170+ tests)
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\qa-test.ps1
```

### Running the Study Server

Double-click `start-study.bat` — the server starts at `http://localhost:8080`
and your browser opens automatically.

Or from PowerShell:
```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\start-study.ps1
```

### Pushing to Kindle Fire

```powershell
# Build EPUB and push all files to Kindle via ADB
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\package_epub.ps1
```

Then open Silk browser on Kindle and navigate to:
`file:///data/local/tmp/index.html`

## Bible Text Edition

This project uses the **King James Version (1769) Blayney Standard Edition** —
the scholarly standard text that nearly all modern KJV Bibles are based on.

The KJV was first published in 1611, but the text widely recognized as "the
KJV" today is the result of Benjamin Blayney's 1769 Oxford revision, which
standardized spelling, punctuation, and corrected printing errors that had
crept into earlier editions. The source OSIS file used by this project
carefully tracks textual details down to individual punctuation marks
(e.g. a documented comma discrepancy between Blayney's quarto and folio
editions at Genesis 1:2), and aligns the Words of Christ (red letter
markup) with Louis Klopsch's 1901 edition — the publisher who popularized
red-letter Bibles.
